# Amplifier: Supercharged AI Development Environment

> "I have more ideas than time to try them out" — The problem we're solving

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is a research demonstrator. It is in early development and may change significantly. Using permissive AI tools in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

## What Is Amplifier?

**Amplifier is a complete development environment that takes AI coding assistants and supercharges them with discovered patterns, specialized expertise, and powerful automation — turning a helpful assistant into a force multiplier that can deliver complex solutions with minimal hand-holding.**

We've taken our learnings about what works in AI-assisted development and packaged them into a ready-to-use environment. Instead of starting from scratch every session, you get immediate access to proven patterns, specialized agents for different tasks, and workflows that actually work.

> [!NOTE]
> **AI Provider Support**: Amplifier now supports both **Claude Code SDK** and **GitHub Copilot CLI** as AI providers. Choose the one that works best for your workflow. See [`amplifier/ccsdk_toolkit/COPILOT_SUPPORT.md`](amplifier/ccsdk_toolkit/COPILOT_SUPPORT.md) for details on using GitHub Copilot CLI.

**Amplifier provides powerful tools and systems:**

- **20+ Specialized Agents**: Each expert in specific tasks (architecture, debugging, security, etc.)
- **Pre-loaded Context**: Proven patterns and philosophies built into the environment
- **Parallel Worktree System**: Build and test multiple solutions simultaneously
- **Knowledge Extraction System**: Transform your documentation into queryable, connected knowledge
- **Conversation Transcripts**: Never lose context - automatic export before compaction, instant restoration
- **Automation Tools**: Quality checks and patterns enforced automatically

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

- **Python 3.11+** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Node.js** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **VS Code** (recommended) - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

> **Platform Note**: Development and testing has primarily been done in Windows WSL2. macOS and Linux should work but have received less testing. Your mileage may vary.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier.git
   cd amplifier
   ```

2. **Run the installer**:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

   This installs Python dependencies and sets up your environment. For AI assistant setup, see the [AI Provider Support](#ai-provider-support) note above.

3. **Configure your data directories** (Recommended but optional):

   **Why configure this?** By default, Amplifier stores data in `.data/` (git-ignored). But centralizing your data externally gives you:

   - **Shared knowledge across all worktrees** - Every parallel experiment accesses the same knowledge base
   - **Cross-device synchronization** - Work from any machine with the same accumulated knowledge
   - **Automatic cloud backup** - Never lose your extracted insights
   - **Reusable across projects** - Apply learned patterns to new codebases

   Set up external directories:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to point to your preferred locations
   ```

   Example configuration using cloud storage:

   ```bash
   # Centralized knowledge base - shared across all worktrees and devices
   # Using OneDrive/Dropbox/iCloud enables automatic backup!
   AMPLIFIER_DATA_DIR=~/OneDrive/amplifier/data

   # Your source materials (documentation, specs, design docs, notes)
   # Can point to multiple folders where you keep content
   AMPLIFIER_CONTENT_DIRS=.data/content,~/OneDrive/amplifier/content,~/Documents/notes
   ```

4. **Activate the environment** (if not already active):
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac/WSL
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

## 📖 How to Use Amplifier

### Basic Usage

Start your AI assistant in the Amplifier directory to get all enhancements automatically:

```bash
cd amplifier
claude  # If using Claude Code
# OR
copilot  # If using GitHub Copilot (see COPILOT_SUPPORT.md for details)
```

### Using with Your Own Projects

Want Amplifier's power on your own code? Easy:

1. **Start your AI assistant with both directories**:

   ```bash
   # If using Claude Code
   claude --add-dir /path/to/your/project
   
   # If using GitHub Copilot, navigate to your project directory
   cd /path/to/your/project
   copilot
   ```

2. **Tell your AI assistant where to work** (paste as first message):

   ```
   I'm working in /path/to/your/project which doesn't have Amplifier files.
   Please cd to that directory and work there.
   Do NOT update any issues or PRs in the Amplifier repo.
   ```

3. **Use Amplifier's agents on your code**:
   - "Use the zen-architect agent to design my application's caching layer"
   - "Deploy bug-hunter to find why my login system is failing"
   - "Have security-guardian review my API implementation for vulnerabilities"

### Parallel Development

**Why use this?** Stop wondering "what if" — build multiple solutions simultaneously and pick the winner.

```bash
# Try different approaches in parallel
make worktree feature-jwt     # JWT authentication approach
make worktree feature-oauth   # OAuth approach in parallel

# Compare and choose
make worktree-list            # See all experiments
make worktree-rm feature-jwt  # Remove the one you don't want
```

Each worktree is completely isolated with its own branch, environment, and context.

See the [Worktree Guide](docs/WORKTREE_GUIDE.md) for advanced features, such as hiding worktrees from VSCode when not in use, adopting branches from other machines, and more.

### Enhanced Status Line

See costs, model, and session info at a glance:

**Example**: `~/repos/amplifier (main → origin) Opus 4.1 💰$4.67 ⏱18m`

Shows:

- Current directory and git branch/status
- Model name with cost-tier coloring (red=high, yellow=medium, blue=low)
- Running session cost and duration

Enable with (Claude Code only):

```
/statusline use the script at .claude/tools/statusline-example.sh
```

[See `.claude/AGENTS_CATALOG.md` for the complete list]

### Knowledge Base

**Why use this?** Stop losing insights. Every document, specification, design decision, and lesson learned becomes part of your permanent knowledge that your AI assistant can instantly access.

> [!NOTE]
> Knowledge extraction is an evolving feature that continues to improve with each update.

1. **Add your content** (any text-based files: documentation, specs, notes, decisions, etc.)

2. **Build your knowledge base**:

   ```bash
   make knowledge-update  # Extracts concepts, relationships, patterns
   ```

3. **Query your accumulated wisdom**:
   ```bash
   make knowledge-query Q="authentication patterns"
   make knowledge-graph-viz  # See how ideas connect
   ```

### Conversation Transcripts

**Never lose context again.** Amplifier automatically exports your entire conversation before compaction, preserving all the details that would otherwise be lost. When your AI assistant (Claude Code) compacts your conversation to stay within token limits, you can instantly restore the full history.

**Automatic Export**: A PreCompact hook captures your conversation before any compaction event:

- Saves complete transcript with all content types (messages, tool usage, thinking blocks)
- Timestamps and organizes transcripts in `.data/transcripts/`
- Works for both manual (`/compact`) and auto-compact events

**Easy Restoration**: Use the `/transcripts` command in Claude Code to restore your full conversation:

```
/transcripts  # Restores entire conversation history (Claude Code only)
```

The transcript system helps you:

- **Continue complex work** after compaction without losing details
- **Review past decisions** with full context
- **Search through conversations** to find specific discussions
- **Export conversations** for sharing or documentation

**Transcript Commands** (via Makefile):

```bash
make transcript-list            # List available transcripts
make transcript-search TERM="auth"  # Search past conversations
make transcript-restore         # Restore full lineage (for CLI use)
```

### Modular Builder (Lite)

A one-command workflow to go from an idea to a module (**Contract & Spec → Plan → Generate → Review**) inside the Amplifier AI environment (currently optimized for Claude Code).

- **Run inside a Claude Code session:**
  ```
  /modular-build Build a module that reads markdown summaries, synthesizes net-new ideas with provenance, and expands them into plans. mode: auto level: moderate
  ```
- **Docs:** see `docs/MODULAR_BUILDER_LITE.md` for the detailed flow and guardrails.
- **Artifacts:** planning goes to `ai_working/<module>/…` (contract/spec/plan/review); code & tests to `amplifier/<module>/…`.
- **Isolation & discipline:** workers read only this module’s **contract/spec** plus dependency **contracts**. The spec’s **Output Files** are the single source of truth for what gets written. Every contract **Conformance Criterion** maps to tests. 〔Authoring Guide〕

#### Modes

- `auto` (default): runs autonomously if confidence ≥ 0.75; otherwise falls back to `assist`.
- `assist`: asks ≤ 5 crisp questions to resolve ambiguity, then proceeds.
- `dry-run`: plan/validate only (no code writes).

#### Continue later

Re‑run `/modular-build` with a follow‑up ask; it resumes from `ai_working/<module>/session.json`.

### Development Commands

```bash
make check            # Format, lint, type-check
make test             # Run tests
make ai-context-files # Rebuild AI context
```

## 💡 Example Workflows

### Building a Feature in Your Code

1. **Design**: "Use zen-architect to design my notification system"
2. **Build**: "Have modular-builder implement the notification module"
3. **Test**: "Deploy test-coverage to add tests for the new notification feature"

### Debugging Your Application

1. **Investigate**: "Use bug-hunter to find why my application's API calls are failing"
2. **Verify**: "Have security-guardian review my authentication implementation"

### Knowledge-Driven Development

1. **Extract**: `make knowledge-update` (processes your documentation)
2. **Query**: `make knowledge-query Q="error handling patterns"`
3. **Apply**: "Implement error handling using patterns from our knowledge base"
